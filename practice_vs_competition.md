## Practice versus competition

Practice is different from the competition setup in several aspects.

_This document will be updated as decisions are made about the competition setup._

### Worlds

The final competition will happen in a world which contains all 3 tasks, and the
tasks must be completed in a row, or explicitly skipped.

The world provided during practice is similar to the worlds which will be used
during the competition, but not exactly the same. It's a good idea to practice
with different world setups to be prepared for the finals.

A handy script which can be used to generate randomized worlds is provided,
take a look [here](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/srcsim/wiki/world_generator).

### Setup

You won't have direct access to Gazebo during the competition, both to the
graphical interface and to the terminal running it. So you won't be able to
have a 3rd person view of the robot and the environment, or read console status
messages. Get used to interacting exclusively through ROS messages.
