This tutorial aims to explain how to control the R5’s arm and grasping.  This tutorial assumes you have already setup your system for SRC, and can successfully run the SRC qualifiers and/or the main competition.  If this isn’t true, please see the previous [tutorials](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/srcsim/wiki/tutorials) on how to do this.

This tutorial is broken into two parts.  In the first part, we’ll cover how to control the arm, both from the keyboard and in your own code.  In the second part, we'll cover how to control the hand, both from the keyboard and in your own code.
