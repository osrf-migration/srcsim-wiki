# Overview

SRC qualification 2 is a locomotion basic manipulation task. The qualification loads with R5 standing in front of a doorway with a closed door and a red button. 

You must walk next to the red button, press it, and cross the doorway once the door opens. Score is based on your ability to press the button and walking through the doorway, where R5 must walk one meter beyond the door without falling, as well as the time required to complete the task.

There is a line in front of the initial position of R5. When you cross the line your task will start. At one meter after the doorway there is a second line. Crossing the finish line will finish the task.
