# Overview

SRC qualification 1 is an image processing task. The qualification loads with R5 standing in front of a console. Located on the console are a number of LEDs and screens, all of which are black. The large screen in the center of the console transitions from blue to white. This transition marks the start of the task.

One at a time, twenty LEDs will turn on (red) then off after the center screen's transition from blue to white.
